Gordon Walters-style koru patterns in Processing.
=================================================

This Processing sketch creates random images in the style of [Gordon Walters'
Koru series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Walters). I wrote a blog post
about it
[here](http://crash.net.nz/posts/2013/10/gordon-walters-koru-patterns-in-processing/).

The code is mine, but the idea and inspiration comes from Gordon Walters.
